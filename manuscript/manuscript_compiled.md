The purpose of this article is two-fold: (1) to gain a better overview of the NGO anti-trafficking in persons (TIP) sector and (2) to learn what these NGOs think of one of the largest anti-TIP programs there is, namely that run by the US government.

Since the US launched its global campaign against trafficking in 2000, criticism has abounded [@Chacon:2006; @Nathan:2005; @Wooditch:2011; @HorningThomasHenninger:2014]. Critics have invoked old standby label of US overreach—"global sheriff." They argue that by conditioning its non-humanitarian non-trade related assistance on governments' efforts to fight trafficking, the US has imposed a "unilateral" "sanctions regime" that is at odds with international law, ineffective, and imposes US norms under the guise of international law [@Chuang:2006]. Others accuse the US of furthering disagreements about the relationship between prostitution and trafficking [@LerumMcCurtisSaunders:2012].^[The creators of the TVPA were motivated by efforts to eliminate prostitution and wrote bans on funding into the TVPA to anything related to prostitution or to organizations that did not renounce prostitution. This became part of the Bush administration's global anti-prostitution policies, which prohibited some organizations from receiving anti-TIP funding. These policies were eventually successfully challenged in a 2013 Supreme Court ruling.] Some labeled early US anti-TIP efforts as the president' campaign to "promote restrictive policies on reproductive rights and sexuality throughout the world" [@Foerster:2009, 153].^[A critical discussion of the way the US has defined trafficking norms compared with the UN protocol can be found in much of the work of Chuang and is also discussed in various congressional research reports [@SiskinWylerSeelke:2009, 439–440; @Wyler:2013; @Chuang:2014; @Chuang:2006; @GallagherChuang:2012].] Yet others have accused the report's use of the term "modern day slavery," as too expansive a label that has been used to enable "exploitation creep" to broaden the US sphere of influence.^[Chuang notes "This exploitation creep has the compelling goal of widening the anti-trafficking net to capture more forms of exploitation. But close analysis reveals that it is also a technique to protect the hegemony of a particular U.S. anti-trafficking approach—one having broad bipartisan support in U.S. politics—and to fend off competing approaches calling for labor rights and migration policy reforms that are particularly contentious in the U.S. context. Exploitation creep enables the United States to expand its 'anti-trafficking' influence over areas once deemed non-trafficked forced labor and to generate, via 'slavery' rebranding, heightened moral condemnation and commitment to its cause" [-@Chuang:2014, 611]. @Gallagher:2011 offers an excellent analysis of the TIP reports.] Others argue that the policy (as well as the Palermo Protocol itself) causes "collateral damage," a term used to capture the fact that anti-trafficking policies can harm victims [@Gallagher:2015]. Finally, critics point to the ratings used in the annual US TIP report as politically biased [@Garcia:2006; @Wooditch:2011]. A blatant case was Malaysia's 2015 upgrade to the Watchlist to facilitate the Transpacific Partnership after congress had prohibited the inclusion of Tier 3 countries in the deal [@RosenbergCochrane:2015; @SzepSpetalnick:2015]. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has acknowledged some weaknesses, as has the Inspector General's Office [@gao-06-825:2006; @dos-oig:2012]. Despite such criticism, others have recognized the report as "the most influential and the most trusted indicator of states' performance vis-à-vis human trafficking," [@ZaloznayaHagan:2012, 18] and credit the policy with reinforcing the core provisions of the Palermo Protocol [@Gallagher:2015]. Research has found that the policy has contributed to criminalization of human trafficking worldwide [@KelleySimmons:2015; @Kelley:2016].

The close scrutiny of the US campaign against human trafficking is warranted, but amid all these academic and policy debates, one key perspective has not been heard, namely that of NGOs who work with trafficking on the ground. What do anti-TIP NGOs think of the US efforts and their relationship with the US? 

Collaboration with civil society organizations and NGOs has long been part of the United States' core strategy for battling human trafficking around the world. The US State Department's TIP report—compiled annually since 2001 by J/TIP—is perhaps the most visible symbol of the relationship between the US and anti-TIP NGOs. Since the report's inception, the State Department has collaborated with NGOs, using published reports and expert testimony from the organizations working directly with human trafficking victims. Early reports regularly acknowledged NGOs for their advocacy and assistance with information gathering. In 2004 the the State Department added a new regular "TIP Heroes" section to the report to highlight the work of prominent activists. These individuals have since been honored at the annual TIP report releases and invited to give speeches about their work, providing these activists with a very public platform to highlight their advocacy. Secretary John Kerry has continued and strengthened this tradition—in 2015, the State Department partnered with the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center to publish a website dedicated to its 100 TIP heroes.^[See [www.tipheroes.org](http://www.tipheroes.org/).]

In addition to providing information for the TIP reports, anti-TIP NGOs are central to the fight against human trafficking.^[http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm - longer footnote quoting Kerry] They deliver many of the services, raise awareness, interact with the victims first hand, observe the weaknesses in the domestic anti-TIP efforts, and often work closely with local authorities.

NGOs are therefore not only central actors in the fight against human trafficking, but also well positioned to assess the US policy. This article presents the results of a global survey on NGOs in XXX countries around the world. To our knowledge, this is the first survey of its kind. Not only does the survey cast light on their views of the US efforts, it also provides a snapshot of global NGO efforts on the ground. The results show that the global NGO community is remarkably supportive of US efforts despite its acknowledged flaws. Most find the TIP report to be useful tool. These views are not simply because the US funds these organizations—most organizations received no US funding and the views among these remain largely positive.

This suggests that the policy is worth keeping and improving.

# The United States and anti-TIP efforts

On October 18, 2000, the US adopted comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, or TVPA [@Efrat:2012, chapter 5; @DeStefano:2007]. The TVPA was one of the first dedicated national anti-trafficking laws, and its international dimension was striking. The Act created the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons within the State Department (TIP Office), which was tasked to "[m]easure and evaluate progress of the United States and other countries in the areas of trafficking prevention, protection, and assistance to victims of trafficking, and prosecution and enforcement against traffickers, including the role of public corruption in facilitating trafficking." Countries were to be placed into tiers, *not according to the scope of the problem, but according to their efforts.* The Act set "minimum standards" [@usg-pl-106-386:2000, §108] for the elimination of trafficking: Tier 1 was for countries that meet the minimal standards, Tier 2 for countries who do not meet them but are making significant efforts to do so, and Tier 3 was for countries failing to meet the minimal standards. The Watchlist, first used in 2004, was for countries at risk of falling to Tier 3. The Act also authorized monetary assistance to help countries meet the criteria and prohibited US “nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance” to countries making insufficient efforts, although this has rarely been meaningfully implemented.

The TIP Office has grown from a few staff in 2001 to over 50 people in 2015, and is headed by an ambassador-at-large to combat trafficking in persons. The office works closely with embassies, which in turn work with governments and NGOs. The office also works with other US agencies that work abroad such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and USAID.

The US embassies discuss the report with policy makers at various levels in each country. Right after the report comes out, the embassy usually meets with officials to discuss the report and recommendations. Throughout the year the local embassy also discusses the issue with local officials, NGOs and other stakeholders. The frequency of such meetings varies across countries. The local embassy also may arrange workshops or training for government officials. The TIP office also sends emissaries. The ambassador usually makes several trips a year to multiple countries to reiterate the recommendations.

# Data and methods

Because we were interested in views of the US work around the world, we focused our survey on anti-TIP NGOs working outside the US. From July–December 2014 we surveyed organizations engaged in anti-trafficking initiatives in 133 countries. To construct the initial outreach, we conducted hundreds of internet searches and drew on multiple other online resources, listed in the appendix.[^datasources] These efforts produced a database of 1,103 operating anti-TIP NGOs with valid contact information. We received responses from 480 unique organizations, yielding a response rate of 43.5%, which far exceeds that of most NGO surveys [@BaruchHoltom:2008]. Because NGOs often work in multiple countries, we allowed respondents to answer a series of country-specific questions for up to five different countries, resulting in 561 country-organization responses. The majority of respondents (415, or 86.5%) answered for only one country, while 65 respondents reported on TIP work in two or more countries.

Online surveys pose several methodological challenges. First, they introduce a technology bias. Small grassroots organizations without an online presence are completely missing from our database. Additionally, NGOs without easy internet access or who could not reply in English faced barriers to participate. As a result, the survey does not represent the entire sector. Finally, all surveys have response bias—willingness to participate is rarely random.

We took several additional steps to address these biases and threats to validity, based on the methods and recommendations of others [@Buthe:2011; @EdwardsRobertsClarke:2009]. To encourage participation, we sent each NGO a set of three personalized e-mail invitations, re-sent approximately every two weeks. Organizations without a working e-mail address were contacted by phone. Finally, we posted an invitation to participate in the survey in a LinkedIn discussion group used by anti-trafficking NGOs, although this yielded few responses. Each invitation included a link to the survey and an offer to complete the survey via phone, and respondents were allowed to remain anonymous. To reduce language barriers, we translated the survey into Spanish and Russian and encouraged respondents to answer all free-response questions in their native language. We provided additional reminders and assistance to respondents who began the survey but did not complete it (often due to technological issues). The vast majority of respondents (463, or 96.5%) completed the survey online; 14 were completed over the phone and 3 were collected via the LinkedIn invitation.

Finally, to avoid response-bias and cueing respondents who might have particular views of the US, we framed the survey as an effort to better understand the anti-TIP advocacy sector in general. To reinforce this emphasis, we first asked respondents about their organizations in general and their knowledge of TIP issues in the countries they work in, and then asked which actors (embassies, NGOs, international organizations, etc.) had been active in those countries, allowing them to volunteer information about the US embassy without prompting. Only *after this* did we ask questions specifically about the presence and quality of the United States' anti-TIP work. In 33 instances, respondents did not initially list the US as an active anti-TIP player in the free response question, but later indicated US support and advocacy, which suggests that NGOs did not decide to participate in the survey based on their prior opinions of the United States. Additionally, nearly 90% percent of respondents completed the survey after beginning it, revealing that NGOs generally did not change their decision to participate once the survey turned to US-focused questions. The statement in our invitations that the principal investigator was a professor at an American university was the only indication that the survey could contain questions related specifically to the United States. However, the invitation emphasized that the purpose of the survey was to help build a complete database of anti-TIP NGOs and to understand their efforts. The language of the invitation and the entire survey can be found at example.com/survey. Thus, we minimized the likelihood that opinions of the US and its anti-TIP efforts influenced decisions to participate in the survey, thereby reducing response bias.

We merge survey responses with several supplementary data sources in order to compare NGO experiences with more quantitative country-level characteristics. We calculate each country's average TIP rating between 2000–2015, as well as the absolute change in rating from the first year to the most recent year each country was included in the TIP report.^[Coded as 1, 2, and 3 for each tier level and 2.5 for countries on the Watchlist.] We use data from the 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index to measure each country's progress in improving human anti-trafficking prosecution, protection, and prevention [@Cho:2015]. This index is based exclusively on independent assessments of the annual TIP report and measures progress in a host of specific sub-indicators, ultimately yielding a score between 3–15, with higher numbers indicating better progress.^[See [http://www.economics-human-trafficking.net/data-and-reports.html](http://www.economics-human-trafficking.net/data-and-reports.html).] We look at both the official TIP ratings and the 3P index because the two indicators measure different phenomena. TIP ratings reflect formal US diplomatic pressure and act as a form of scorecard diplomacy [@KelleySimmons:2015], while the 3P index reflects the concrete progress that governments have made in specified policy areas. As with the raw tier ratings, we calculate each country's average TIP policy index and the absolute change between the first and most recent year. Finally, we use the sum of political rights and civil liberties from Freedom House's *Freedom in the World* index as a proxy for a country's level of democratization.^[See [https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world](https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world).]

We report basic summary statistics and cross-tabulations of survey responses. The statistical findings are solely descriptive and serve to help interpret many of the trends we discovered in the anti-TIP NGO sector. We use inferential statistics (including *t*-tests, chi-square tests, and one-way ANOVA) only to check for differences in means and associations between responses.

In addition to statistical analysis, we rely on interpretive qualitative analysis of NGOs' free response answers—82% of respondents chose to answer at least one of the 12 open-ended questions. One of this study's primary contributions is to allow NGOs themselves to speak about their experiences, and as such, we extensively quote their responses. To maintain anonymity we removed all potentially identifiable information from any quotes used in this paper—we reference the source of each quote with a randomly-assigned four-digit ID number.

# Questions

We analyzed the results of our survey to answer three general questions about the anti-TIP NGO sector and its relationship to the United States' anti-TIP efforts: 

- **An overview of the TIP sector**: What does the anti-TIP NGO sector look like and what kind of work do individual NGOs do? How knowledgeable are they of their governments' policies and how closely do they work with the government?
- **Experiences with the US**: How do anti-TIP NGOs experience the extent and character of the United States' anti-trafficking efforts? How do they interact with the US, if at all?
- **Views of US policy**: How do anti-TIP NGOs assess the United States' efforts and what factors correlate with their opinion?

# Findings

## An overview of the TIP sector

### Where do anti-TIP NGOs work?

The anti-TIP NGOs we surveyed are spread throughout the world and have a nearly global reach. As seen in [@fig:locations], 60% of NGOs have their headquarters in either Asia or Europe, roughly a quarter are based in North or South America, and fewer than 20% work out of Africa. NGOs are not limited to advocacy within their own countries—the majority of these organizations work in Asia (especially in trafficking hotspots like India, Nepal, Thailand, and the Philippines), with less work in Europe and the Americas. Though fewer NGOs are *based* in Africa, a larger proportion of NGOs *work* there than in the Americas. Organizations based in the Americas, in particular, are more likely to work outside their home regions, although this may be because we tried to exclude US NGOs who worked only in the United States: only 50% of American NGOs work in the Americas, with 30% working in Asia and 12% in Africa. In contrast, NGOs based elsewhere are much more likely to stay close to home, as 98%, 97%, and 83% of NGOs headquartered in Asia, Africa, and Africa work in their respective regions. 

![NGO headquarters and target countries, by region](figures/fig_locations.pdf){#fig:locations}

### What do anti-TIP NGOs do?

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_what_do.md"

On average, anti-TIP NGOs spend a little over half of their time and resources focused specifically on fighting trafficking and assisting victims and an overwhelming majority (93%) has at least some knowledge about the TIP policies in the countries they work in. Most organizations focus on sex (85%) and labor (61%) trafficking issues; 50% focus on both simultaneously. A handful of organizations (30, or 6%) work with human organ trafficking, and dozens of others deal with other issues such as brokered marriages, domestic servitude, illegal adoptions, and forced begging.

Approximately two-thirds of NGOs serve and advocate for children and/or adult trafficking victims, and many of those who work with adults specified working especially with women and young girls. No type of trafficking issue is more pronounced among different categories of victims—that is, NGOs are generally equally as likely to help both children and adults with either sex or labor trafficking, suggesting a need for both issues across all ages. 

NGOs differ in their strategies and efforts in addressing trafficking. Most organizations (83%) advocate for prevention and improved education about TIP issues, and nearly three-fourths assist trafficking victims by running safe houses and shelters, operating special hotlines, helping start businesses, or providing physical and emotional health care. Half of NGOs are also involved with other forms of advocacy—including lobbying and legislative support—and 40% prosecute traffickers and research related legal issues. As with the types of victims, NGO strategies do not differ by the type of trafficking they address—organizations that address either sex or labor trafficking appear to offer roughly the same mix of programming. All in all, the survey shows that the NGO sector engages comprehensively both with victims and policy advocacy and in many cases provides vital services to a wide range of victims.

### How do anti-TIP NGOs work with other actors?

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_how_work_others.md"

Human trafficking is a complex issue and, accordingly, the anti-TIP NGO sector is quite collaborative. Every respondent reported collaborating, partnering, or interacting with other NGOs or civil society organizations, international organizations, foreign embassies, and the national governments of the countries they work in. Nearly every organization (95%) sees NGOs and civil society organizations as active in dealing with trafficking issues in their countries, and NGOs regularly form partnerships with religious groups, charities, universities, community organizations. Around two-thirds of NGOs indicated that international organizations such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are also active participants in anti-TIP advocacy. Less than half of respondents reported that non-American governments are involved in their countries.

Many NGOs also collaborate with the national governments of the countries they work in, as more than half (53%) have discussed TIP issues directly with the government. NGOs also see their governments as active—about two-thirds of respondents (68%) say that their local and national governments help combatting trafficking, with 61% reporting that the governments in their target countries work at least "somewhat hard" in working against TIP, and 20% feel that those governments have worked "very" or "extremely" hard.

{Has your government improved?}

In recent years, NGOs around the world have faced government crackdowns, increased monitoring, and harsher restrictions [@DupuyRonPrakash:2014a; @DupuyRonPrakash:2015; @Heiss:2016; @Heiss:2016a]. However, overall, anti-TIP NGOs are relatively unencumbered by government regulations, with more than a third of respondents reporting that they feel unrestricted in the countries they work in. Roughly a quarter of NGOs reported feeling either somewhat or very restricted. Those reporting restrictions represent 66 different countries, which is still a significant share. The restrictions range from strict legal requirements to general government antagonism or apathy toward NGO programming. Several NGOs feel restricted because of tax code limitations on charitable advocacy, similar to the political advocacy limitations the US imposes on 501(c)(3) charities.^[Responses 1228 and 1265.] Other organizations experience informal restrictions that hinder advocacy, such as corruption or inefficiency in the police and government bureaucracy. For example, one NGO reported that "we [have] to be certified and continue to submit to monthly reporting, mandatory financial audits, site visits, social welfare approval, government regulations regarding our aftercare property, work permits for all foreign volunteers, annual reporting and additional certifications,"^[Response 1280.] while another noted that "[a]ll work must be approved and done in direct concert with government counterparts. [Our] presence in country [is] controlled and evaluated by government officials, even those who are not familiar with our work."^[Response 1157.] The burden of complying with uncertain regulations can hamper NGOs and detract from their work, limiting their ability to protect victims and prosecute offenders.^[Responses 1016, 1049, 1061, 1118, 1336, 1388, and 1389, among others.]

## Experiences with the US

As central actors in the fight against human trafficking, NGOs have observed the United States' intense anti-TIP efforts (see [@fig:activities]) throughout the world over the past 15 years. Accordingly, NGOs have a unique perspective of the implementation, effectiveness, and effects of American efforts. The organizations that responded to our survey were quite forthcoming about their experiences with the United States' anti-TIP work. NGOs almost universally identify the US as a central driving force for TIP advocacy in the countries they work in. Respondents report that the US State Department's annual TIP report empowers them as they confront and collaborate with national politicians and bureaucrats. NGOs also note that the United States has been particularly effective in its work with local governments, using its TIP reports to pressure governments to implement reforms and then assisting with the practical implementation of new anti-TIP legislation. Finally, NGOs describe the mixed results of the United States' public advocacy. We detail each of these topics in turn.

![Activities and programming sponsored by the US embassy, as reported by NGOs](figures/fig_activities.pdf){#fig:activities}

### The centrality of the United States

While the fight against human trafficking is global in scope and involves the efforts of dozens of actors, NGOs see the United States as by far the most active and influential foreign government. We asked respondents to indicate which embassies they knew to be active in anti-TIP work in each of the countries they work in, and which of those governments were most active. NGOs identified 64 different foreign or regional governments as active, and 78% of respondents included the US embassy or government in their list (see [@fig:embassies]). In fact, the United States was mentioned six times more often (260 mentions) than the next most common country, the United Kingdom (43 mentions). Respondents identified 39 foreign countries as particularly active, and 71% named the US as the most active, which was mentioned 14 times more often (187 mentions) than the next most foreign actor, the European Union (14 mentions). When later asked directly about US activities, only 39 NGOs (7.3%) explicitly reported that the US had *not* been involved in any of the countries they work in.

![Embassies or foreign governments NGOs reported as active partners in the fight against human trafficking](figures/fig_embassies.pdf){#fig:embassies}

### How NGOs use the TIP report

From the perspective of anti-TIP NGOs, the TIP report is perhaps the US government's most potent tool for confronting or working with foreign governments. As discussed previously, the TIP report has been criticized for {XXX and for YYY}. However, for many anti-TIP NGOs the report is an important resource for their advocacy and policy work. The overwhelming majority (87%) of the NGOs surveyed were aware of the report, and of those organizations that had heard of it, three-quarters (76%) said they knew the rating assigned to the country or countries they worked in. About half of the NGOs (52%) use the TIP report to discuss trafficking issues with the governments of the countries they work, including individual members of parliament, courts, national and local police forces, and community leaders.^[Responses 1077, 1165, 1280, 1296, 1343, 1349, and 1473.] Notably, the majority of respondents (78%) use the TIP report in their work with other NGOs, indicating its importance within the NGO community. Many organizations reference the report when working with local church groups, schools, trade unions, community centers, youth organizations, and other domestic civil society organizations.^[Responses 1008, 1144, 1247, 1343, 1371, 1422, 1463, and 1463.] Others cite the report in their own advocacy literature and annual reports.^[Responses 1190, 1286, 1292, 1325, 1337, 1420, and 1437.]

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_tip_report.md"

A minority of respondents was critical, however. Some organizations found it unhelpful and superficial,^[Response 1157.] that it does not reflect the reality of trafficking issues,^[Responses 1076 and 1079.] or that it "is so far removed from the truth [that] it appears propagandistic."^[Response 1060.] Another NGO found that using the TIP report in their advocacy posed a significant political risk due to anti-American sentiment in the country they work in.^[Response 1303.] Fourteen NGOs explicitly reported that they do not use the TIP report in any of their work with governments or other NGOs.

### NGO views of their governments' attitude toward the US TIP rankings

As these NGOs advocate and work with governments to improve TIP policy, many have witnessed the effect of the TIP rating on behind-the-scenes politics and policy discussions—a little less than half of respondents (43%) indicated that they had heard officials in the countries they work in mention the TIP tier rating. NGOs report that the governments of the countries they work in tend to mention tier ratings in several contexts. Many government officials publicly tout their rating to demonstrate or showcase their achievements^[Responses 1090 and 1377.] and promote their countries as models for fighting and preventing human trafficking.^[Response 1246.] Some officials even tout their rating "[at] every possible chance."^[Response 1442.] NGOs report that officials used the TIP ranking to convey shame about their countries' progress. Officials often redirect this shame to help "initiate, justify and strengthen the activities of the government"^[Response 1497.] and provide additional motivation to pursue anti-TIP policies. Thus, NGOs provided several examples of ways that the TIP report and US support helped improve anti-TIP efforts in the countries they work in. 

That said, some NGOs also reported pushback against the report. They note that some officials expressed frustration—both in public and in private—that the TIP report did not adequately reflect progress. One NGO held a private conversation with an official who was concerned that the poor tier rating made it "it look like [the government] [doesn't] care, but they actually do."^[Response 1255.] Another noted that government officials often feel that they are rated "unfairly"^[Response 1077.] or that the rating is "unjustified."^[Response 1457.] One NGO noted that some officials blame the United States, claiming that "the placement in such a rating is politically motivated does not reflect the actual work of the state,"^[Response 1396, translated from original language.] and that the tier ratings are simply a general reflection of relations with the United States. Other NGOs report that government officials accuse NGOs—which provide much of the source material for the TIP report—of "making false claims."^[Response 1029.] Finally, a few NGOs said that governments have used favorable tier rankings as an excuse to stop working on TIP issues, stating that a common government response is that "because [the country] has been ranked tier 1, there is no need to take additional action" or pursue further anti-TIP legislation.^[Response 1387.]

More than 40% of NGOs indicated that the US has increased government attention to TIP issues in the countries they work in, and the majority of these organizations specifically noted that the US embassy had used the TIP report to do so. Many see the report as the United States' primary means for working directly with foreign governments, noting that the report has been an "extremely important,"^[Response 1475.] "very effective,"^[Response 1442.] and "quite useful"^[Response 1390.] tool that allows the US government to "[suggest] changes to anti-trafficking laws and policy, [raise] awareness about trafficking, and [increase] [foreign government] attention to trafficking."^[Response 1158.] NGOs also observe that US officials use the report to threaten, pressure, and embarrass offending governments,^[Responses 1017, 1158, and 1259.] and state that the report "force[s] an official response from the government … every year when it is released."^[Response 1387.] Several NGOs are aware that embassies invite high-ranking government officials and party leaders for formal discussions about the report's recommendations and future steps.^[Responses 1104, 1259, and 1360.] 

### Effects of US efforts on national governments

Anti-TIP NGOs also observe that the US pushes for policy changes in their countries. Approximately a third of respondents (31%) report that State Department or embassy staff have explicitly asked or lobbied for anti-TIP legislation. One organization observed that each time the US ambassador meets with government officials, he reminds them of the need to finalize national legislation and adhere to UN Security Council resolutions related to trafficking and women's rights.^[Response 1202.] In several countries, NGOs state that the US encouraged and lobbied presidents, prime ministers, and legislators to adopt a wide range of laws mandating increased monitoring through regular data collection and inspections, improved prosecutions under stricter criminal statutes, tighter border controls and travel restrictions.^[Responses 1021, 1213, 1274, 1307, 1353, 1486, and 1505.] Two NGOs made special note of formal visits between their countries' respective presidents and then-Secretary Clinton where she explicitly encouraged and lobbied for anti-TIP regulations.^[Responses 1251 and 1255.]

Beyond lobbying for the passage of legislation, NGOs report that the US also has helped governments develop practical TIP action plans (27%) and provided training to officials who oversee those policies (21%). After legislation is passed, NGOs observe American involvement and support in the implementation of new TIP-related policies. In many cases, the US meets with government officials to show examples of action plans implemented in peer countries and provide other technical assistance and policy guidance.^[Responses 1099, 1327, 1397, and 1514.] Additionally, NGOs note that embassy officials help form intergovernmental task forces and inter-ministerial steering groups to coordinate anti-TIP efforts among various branches of government, as well as organize national trafficking coalitions to integrate government and civil society strategies and programs.^[Responses 1287, 1288, 1290, and 1311.] In at least one country, embassy staff are formal members of the secretariat for the national TIP commission.^[Response 1360.]

NGOs also report considerable US efforts to train those who oversee and implement these national policies. The State Department works with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Department of Homeland Security to provide specialized trainings both in-country and in the United States for foreign law enforcement officers, military personnel, intelligence agents, and counter-trafficking unit staff.^[Responses 1084, 1204, 1251, 1280, 1288, 1336, and 1349.] Embassies also partner with the US Department of Justice to organize trainings to orient judges and prosecutors about the new national legislation and assist with its practical legal implementation.^[Responses 1162, 1381, and 1494.] However, one NGO notes that "the US government has pulled in huge resources for training … government officials[,] but no concrete results [can] be found," in part because "[those] officials have no interest in such training."^[Response 1298.]

### Views of the United States' public advocacy

The State Department's J/TIP office funds dozens of public awareness programs around the world. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of these programs, but one indicator is whether NGOs know about them. Based on our survey results, many NGOs are aware of these on-the-ground efforts. Approximately 40% report that the US has run public awareness programs in their countries. In several countries, NGOs observe that US embassies hold special press conferences and other events following the release of the annual TIP report and publicly acknowledge any TIP Heroes or other recipients of special US awards.^[Responses 1037, 1179, 1208, 1274, 1311, 1336, and 1353.] For example, Ghanaian NGOs explain how the embassy celebrated a local activist who won the US Department of Labor's Iqbal Masih award for the elimination of child labor, while Ukrainian NGOs describe annual human trafficking awards ceremonies for local anti-TIP activists at the US embassy. In addition to such events, NGOs say that embassies hold town hall meetings, film nights, and other events and discussions with featured speakers and experts and use social media platforms (including embassy Facebook and Twitter accounts) to directly engage with the broader public.^[Responses 1011, 1019, 1369, and 1503.] Embassies also often work directly with national and local media, producing public service announcements and partnering with community leaders, religious figures, and prominent television and movie actors as part of public information campaigns.^[Responses 1019, 1035, 1084, and 1288.]

In addition to promoting awareness, NGOs report that the US engages directly in many other public-facing anti-TIP activities. Nearly 40% of respondents indicated that the US had convened special workshops and conferences focused on TIP issues in the countries they work in. These workshops tend to be structured as one-day training sessions focused on "trying to get everybody to work together."^[Response 1254.] Embassy officials bring together American federal agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, domestic law enforcement agencies, local and national government officials, civil society leaders, and all other relevant stakeholders to discuss trafficking issues and formulate policies. Many NGOs applaud these efforts, claiming that they are especially good at bringing government and civil society together and providing space to "express their opinions [and] share their experiences" with policymakers.^[Response 1104.] Workshops aimed specifically at linking NGO and government policy efforts are seen as especially effective.^[Response 1351.] NGOs also note that embassies hold specialized workshops aimed at training and increasing awareness and sensitization for specific industries and firms that tend to be more vulnerable and prone to trafficking, including orphanages, military bases, and the construction and transportation sectors.^[Responses 1072, 1235, 1382 and 1479.]

Not all NGOs feel that these workshops and trainings are useful, however. While most claim that the workshops are good, many noted that the embassy "didn't invite as many people" as they would have liked to see,^[Response 1254.] "discussion time is too [short],"^[Response 1457.] and that there is rarely any follow-up on the discussions, decisions, or promised actions.^[Responses 1227 and 1457.] Some also criticized the embassy for being too insular and limiting participation to only a few prominent NGOs, and several expressed a desire to be invited to future conferences.^[Responses 1372 and 1378.] In short, though NGOs generally see US-run workshops and conferences as useful venues for promoting anti-TIP policy and advocacy, these events are often insufficient. "Why stop there?," asked one respondent—"If this is a country flagged by the US, why stop there? We need to provide more help and training."^[Response 1254.]

Sometimes bilateral aid is not very visible to civil society. However, many NGOs *do* report that the US does provide much help and training by funding NGO-led initiatives for improving awareness of trafficking and for providing legal and social services for trafficking victims. Nearly 40% of respondents indicated that the US had provided resources or funding for these local organizations and initiatives in the countries they work in. Most organizations note that this support is funneled from the State Department through J/TIP, USAID, and other US-backed foundations or local funding agencies. NGOs report receiving small grant awards to prepare television segments, produce fliers and other print materials, direct street dramas, offer school programs, organize rallies, and conduct other awareness-raising activities, including holding local workshops and conferences for the general public.^[Responses 1131, 1196, 1251, 1377, and 1475.] In conjunction with funding for awareness, NGOs also report receiving substantial support for service provision. Organizations used USAID and J/TIP grants to build safe houses, dormitories, treatment centers, and schools for women and underage victims, offering free medical care, psychological counseling, vocational training, and education in addition to providing shelter and safety.^[Responses 1301, 1307, 1353, and 1404.] NGOs have also used this support to launch and maintain hotlines for raising issues with migration, pay for legal assistance and consultation in trafficking-related crimes, and form formal coalitions of local anti-TIP NGOs to lobby for improved legislation throughout the region.^[Responses 1007, 1072, 1203, 1353, and 1485.] 

US financial support to NGOs, however, appears to be uneven. Many respondents noted that US agencies tend to fund large national NGOs while ignoring smaller organizations that work more closely with trafficking victims or with local advocacy. Some noted that the funding process has become too politicized and that "unless there is someone… that influences [the funding decision]… the neediest entities rarely receive [any money]."^[Response 1238.] Others note that other countries such as Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands have given more direct and effective funding to these frontline NGOs, and some have said that they "don't even bother applying" anymore.^[Responses 1115, 1227, 1378, and 1474.] 

## Views of US policy



!INCLUDE "tables/summary_us_opinions.md"

### Importance of the US in the country

By and large, NGOs have a strikingly positive view of the US efforts. The majority of NGOs ascribe some importance to the US government's substantial global anti-TIP work (see [@tbl:us_opinions]). Six of ten respondents (61%) think that the US is at least a somewhat important actor in the countries where they work, with over a quarter of all NGOs saying that the US is *the most* important. Many organizations emphasize the US's crucial role in their work, and some go so far as to say that "none of our success would have been possible without the TIP report" and other American support.^[Response 1509.] Only 13% of respondents think that the US is unimportant in their countries' anti-TIP fights because it is absent, because it "doesn't make much difference,"^[Response 1254.] or because the US embassy often seems "at least ambivalent, [and] at worst disinterested."^[Response 1221.] 



!INCLUDE "tables/summary_importance_stats_country.md"

Opinions of American importance clearly vary, and a great deal of this variation stems from the different experiences and needs of NGOs across countries. [@fig:avg_importance] displays the average level of reported US importance from NGOs in countries with at least 10 responses. On average, NGOs in most developing countries tend to attribute some importance to the US, while more developed countries like Canada and the United Kingdom ascribe the least importance, perhaps indicative of a diminished demand for American anti-TIP assistance in these countries. 

![Average importance of US anti-TIP efforts (error bars indicate standard deviations)](figures/fig_avg_importance.pdf){#fig:avg_importance}

This association holds up when looking at the level of democratic development in these countries. On average, NGOs working in countries with worse civil rights and political liberties are more likely to see the US as the most important anti-TIP actor in that country, and the overall differences between average total freedom across the possible responses are statistically significant (see [@tbl:importance_stats_country]).

The severity of human trafficking in these countries is also associated with NGO opinions of importance. [@tbl:importance_stats_country] analyzes several statistical associations with country-level characteristics to explore some of the variation in these opinions. These findings are merely descriptive, and should not be interpreted as causal statements. However, the analysis in instructive in that it shows how NGO opinions of US importance vary across sub-groups and thus whether they are likely to be artifacts of certain attributes.  

[@tbl:importance_stats_country] shows that perhaps the opinions of NGOs that work in countries with worse than average TIP report ratings attribute more importance relate less to the US than those in countries with better average ratings. Improvements in tier ratings^[That is, the country's most recent rating is better than its first.] do not seem to change NGO views. NGOs in countries that have made greater improvements in TIP policies (as measured by the 3P index), on the other hand, do attribute more importance to the US. Finally, organizations are significantly more likely to think that the US is an important actor if they work in countries receiving more anti-TIP funding, which correlates with countries with worse tiers.

NGO opinions of the US may be less related to *country* characteristics and more a function of their *individual* relationships and experiences with the US. NGOs that interact more with the US, receive more funding from the US, or have their headquarters there may be positively biased towards the US and rate it more favorably. To explore this, [@tbl:importance_stats_org] analyzes how organization-level characteristics relate to opinions of the US.

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_importance_stats_org.md"

[@tbl:importance_stats_org] shows that funding does influence opinions at an organizational level. The majority of NGOs that report receiving funding directly from the US feel that it is the most important anti-TIP actor. However, only XX% of organizations have received funding, so it is not the case that the US is simply buying endorsements from NGOs. Even when removing all funded NGOs from the sample, XX% still think that the US is an important actor. , having any kind of encounter or involvement with the US embassy, including direct contact, meetings, or other types of cooperation, is associated with higher opinions of US importance. NGOs that reported that the US was an important actor were more likely to have been involved with the US. Importantly, direct experience with the US appears to be more strongly associated with opinions than simple connections to the US—NGOs that are headquartered in the US are not significantly different from their foreign counterparts in their opinions of American importance.


### Positivity

Of the organizations that reported that the US was an important anti-TIP actor, two-thirds agreed that US involvement in the countries they work in had been positive, while roughly 20% stated that US influence had either been mixed or negative. Only two NGOs said that US involvement had been outright negative, so we combine these two categories in our analysis. As with opinions of American importance, NGO opinions of the positivity of US involvement vary (see [@tbl:positivity_stats]). Note that organizations were only asked about US positivity if they responded that the US was either an important or somewhat important actor.



!INCLUDE "tables/summary_positivity_stats_country.md"

Opinions of American positivity vary by the country NGOs work in, but there appears to be less of a split between non-European and North American countries; for instance, NGOs in both Ghana and Canada were unanimous in reporting US positivity. Organizations in countries with the highest average importance—Cambodia and Thailand—were generally more pessimistic and varied their opinions of positivity. These are countries facing enormous human trafficking problems. Help from the US is needed, but the severity and scope of the problem complicates the efforts to fight it. While NGOs working in more democratic countries were more likely to agree that the US was important, their opinions of those efforts are not that different from those of NGOs working in less democratic countries. As with importance, the severity of human trafficking is associated with opinions of US positivity. NGOs that ascribe a clear positive role to the US tend to work in countries with lower TIP tier ratings *and* in countries where those ratings have worsened since 2000. The efforts of the US are more needed in these countries. Similarly, NGOs report that the US plays a more positive role in countries that have seen more improvements in TIP policies. Anti-TIP funding is also associated with opinions of positivity, though inversely from those of importance—organizations working in countries that receive *more* American funding are more likely to have mixed opinions of the US. 

![Average opinions of US positivity in anti-TIP efforts (error bars indicate standard deviations)](figures/fig_avg_positivity.pdf){#fig:avg_positivity}

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_positivity_stats_org.md"



While most country-level factors influence opinions of US positivity, no organizational factors—including whether the NGO received funding from the US, interacted with the US, or is based in the US—are significantly associated with NGO opinions of the positivity of American anti-TIP efforts, suggesting that NGOs are not being coopted by the US.
