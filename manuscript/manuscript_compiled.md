The United States has also long been criticized for … {conflating anti-human trafficking advocacy and support with US foreign policy goals and diplomatic self-interest + anti-TIP efforts just another tool of American foreign policy + more on the negative backlash against US involvement in TIP + we didn't even start monitoring ourselves until 20XX} {reference Reuters article about playing with rankings of 14 different countries to keep diplomatic relations happy: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/04/us-usa-humantrafficking-disputes-special-idUSKCN0Q821Y20150804}

Amid all the academic and policy debates over the role of the United States in fighting human trafficking and its relationship with civil society organizations, one key perspective has been drowned out: what do these anti-TIP NGOs think of their relationship with the US? 

{Why NGOs are valid assessors of this  + nobody's ever asked *them* before + this is the first time anyone has reached out to all these NGOs at once + we  let *them* speak, give them a voice (albeit anonymously and in aggregate)}

Collaboration with civil society organizations and NGOs has long been part of the United States' core strategy for battling human trafficking around the world. The US State Department's Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report—compiled annually since 2001 by the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP)—is perhaps the most visible symbol of the relationship between the US and anti-TIP NGOs. Since the report's inception, the State Department has worked in close partnership with NGOs, using published reports and expert testimony from the activists and advocates working directly with human trafficking victims. For the first three years of the report, NGOs were regularly acknowledge for their advocacy and assistance with information gathering. In 2004, under the direction of Secretary of State Colin Powell, the State Department added a new regular "TIP Heroes" section to the report to highlight the courageous work of important and prominent activists from these NGOs. In 2009, Secretary Hilary Clinton brought selected heroes to press conference for the release of the annual TIP report and invited them to give speeches about their work, providing these activists with a very public platform to highlight their advocacy. Secretary John Kerry has continued and strengthened this tradition—in 2015, the State Department partnered with the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center to publish a website dedicated to its 100 TIP heroes.^[See [www.tipheroes.org](http://www.tipheroes.org/).]

Beyond providing much of the raw material for TIP reports and producing powerful drama, anti-TIP NGOs and the US have a much deeper practical relationship. In his introductory remarks during the release of the 2015 TIP report, Secretary Kerry applauded these NGOs and identified them as central to the fight against human trafficking, noting that "there are leaders from civil society here, and they are, all of them, bolstering the networks that are being built around the world to try to fight back, increasingly creating sophisticated strategies, and *that’s the only way we’re going to succeed in this battle*."^[[http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm](http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm), emphasis added.] {More on the need for the US to work with on-the-ground NGOs; it *has* to network and collaborate with other activists to have any effect}

{Brief outline of the article}


What can we learn from the boomerang model - other actors using NGOs + cooptation and principal-agent donor-recipient stuff - US using NGOs (we see that working because the NGOs are using the report in their advocacy, which is what the state department wants to happen) - how information is used/diffused/distributed by actors + spread of norms (through workshops, trainings)

# The United States and anti-TIP advocacy

{US surprisingly active and more well regarded than anticipated, standing in contrast with activists and governments critical of the TIP reports, angry at its bias and inconsistencies - even governments - but on-the-ground NGOs are happy with it, use it regularly, don't worry about the biases and other issues - useful tool, better than nothing}

# Data and methods

To analyze the opinions of non-American anti-TIP NGOs, from July–December 2014 we surveyed over 500 organizations engaged in anti-trafficking initiatives in 133 countries worldwide. To maximize out reach, we searched the State Department's annual TIP reports and Wikileaks cables for mentions of TIP NGOS. We also conducted hundreds of internet searches and partnered with a US-based organization.^[See the Global Modern Slavery Directory, [http://globalmodernslavery.org](http://globalmodernslavery.org), maintained by the Polaris Project.] This produced a database of 1,100 anti-TIP NGOs. We invited each organization to participate in the study. Of the 1,100 organizations, we found valid contact information for X and received responses from X unique organizations, yielding a response rate of XX%—a rate that is comparable to or exceeds that of other NGO surveys [see @citeme; @citeme2]. Because NGOs often work in multiple countries, we allowed respondents to answer a series of country-specific questions for up to five different countries, resulting in X country-organization responses. 

Our choice to conduct an online survey poses several methodological issues. Collecting data solely through the internet introduces technology and language bias. Collecting data solely through the internet introduces technology and language bias. Small grassroots organizations without an online presence are completely missing from our database. Some NGOs mentioned in Wikileaks cables or State Department reports were absent online, perhaps because they no longer operate. Additionally, NGOs without easy internet access faced barriers to participation. As a result, the survey does not represent the entire sector. Finally, all surveys have response bias—willingness to participate is rarely random.

We took several additional steps to address these biases and threats to validity, based on the methods used by @Buthe:2011. To encourage participation, we sent each NGO a set of three personalized e-mail invitations, re-sent approximately every two weeks. Organizations without a working e-mail address were contacted by phone. Each invitation included a link to the survey and an offer to complete the survey via phone, and respondents were allowed to remain anonymous. To reduce language barriers, we translated the survey into Spanish and Russian and encouraged respondents to answer all free-response questions in their native language. We provided additional reminders and assistance to respondents who began the survey but did not complete it (often due to technological issues). 

Finally, to avoid response-bias and cueing respondents who might have particular views of the US, we  framed the survey as an effort to better understand the anti-TIP advocacy sector in general. To reinforce this emphasis, we first asked respondents about their organizations in general and their knowledge of TIP issues in the countries they work in, and then asked which actors (embassies, NGOs, international organizations, etc.) had been active in those countries, allowing them to unpromptedly volunteer information about the US embassy.  Only *after this* did we ask questions specifically about the presence and quality of the United States' anti-TIP work. In {x} instances, respondents did not initially list the US as an active anti-TIP player in the free response question, but later indicated US support and advocacy, which suggests that the NGOs did not decide to participate in the survey based on their prior opinions of the United States. Additionally, {X} percent of respondents completed the survey after beginning it, revealing that NGOs generally did not change their decision to participate once the survey turned to US-focused questions. The statement in our invitations that the principal investigator was a professor at an American university was the only indication that the survey could contain questions related specifically to the United States. However, the invitation emphasized that the purpose of the survey was to help build a complete database of anti-TIP NGOs and to understand their efforts. The language of the invitation and the entire survey can be found at {URL HERE}. Thus, opinions of the US and its anti-TIP efforts are unlikely to have influenced decisions to participate in the survey, reducing response-bias.

In our analysis, we merge survey responses with several supplementary data sources in order to compare NGO experiences with more quantitative country-level characteristics. We calculate each country's average TIP rating between 2000–2015, as well as the absolute change in rating from the first year to the most recent year each country was included in the TIP report.^[Coded as 1, 2, and 3 for each tier level and 2.5 for countries on the Watchlist.] We use data from the 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index to measure each country's visible progress in improving human anti-trafficking prosecution, protection, and prevention [@Cho:2015]. This index is based exclusively on independent assessments of the annual TIP report and measures progress in a host of specific sub-indicators, ultimately yielding a score between 3–15, with higher numbers indicating better progress.^[See [http://www.economics-human-trafficking.net/data-and-reports.html](http://www.economics-human-trafficking.net/data-and-reports.html).]  As with the raw tier ratings, we calculate each country's average TIP policy index and the absolute change between the first and most recent year. Finally, we use the sum of political rights and civil liberties from Freedom House's *Freedom in the World* index as a proxy for a country's level of democratization.^[See [https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world](https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world).]

For the sake of simplicity, we do not use advanced statistical methods or models, turning instead to basic summaries and simple descriptive statistics, including cross-tabulations, t-tests, and chi-square tests to check for differences in means and associations between responses. In addition to statistical analysis, we rely heavily on interpretive qualitative analysis of NGOs' free response answers—82% of respondents chose to answer at least one of the 12 open-ended questions. One of this study's primary contributions is to allow NGOs themselves to speak about their experiences, and as such, we extensively quote their responses. To maintain anonymity (even when NGOs expressed willingness to be identified), we removed all potentially identifiable information from any quotes used in this paper, indicating the source of each quote with a randomly-assigned four-digit ID number.

## NGO opinions of US activity and importance

While the fight against human trafficking is global in scope and involves the efforts of dozens of foreign governments, NGOs note that the United States is by far one of the most active and influential actors. We asked respondents to indicate which embassies they knew to be active in anti-TIP work in each of the countries they work in, and which of those governments were most active. NGOs identified 64 different foreign or regional governments as active, and 78% of respondents included the US embassy or government in their list (see [@fig:embassies]). In fact, the United States was mentioned six times more often (260 mentions) than the next most common country, the United Kingdom (43 mentions). Respondents identified 39 countries or regions as the *most* active, and 71% named the US. Again, the United States was overwhelmingly the most cited foreign actor, mentioned 14 times more often (187 mentions) than the next most common government, the European Union (14 mentions). When asked directly about US activities, only 39 NGOs (7.3%) explicitly reported that the US had *not* been involved in any of the countries they work in. NGOs have clearly seen the effects of US funding and involvement in anti-TIP work.

![Embassies or foreign governments NGOs reported as active partners in the fight against human trafficking](figures/fig_embassies.pdf) {#fig:embassies}

We asked respondents to comment on their perceptions of US-led anti-TIP advocacy, both with local and national governments and with the general public (see [@fig:activities]). Organizations noted that the United States has been particularly effective in its work with local governments, using its TIP reports to pressure governments to implement TIP reforms and then assisting with the implementation of new anti-TIP legislation. NGOs also described how the US sponsors dozens of programs aimed at improving public awareness of TIP issues, including workshops and conferences where experts train activists, government officials, and the general public. Additionally, NGOs reported a variety of grants and other support for organizations that publicly advocate and provide legal and social services for TIP victims.

### Direct work with the government

From the perspective of anti-TIP NGOs, the State Department's annual TIP report is perhaps the US government's most potent tool for confronting or working with foreign governments. More than 40% of respondents indicated that the United States has increased government attention to TIP issues in the countries they work in, and the majority of these organizations specifically mentioned the US embassy's use of the TIP report in those countries. Many see the report as the United States' primary means for working directly with foreign governments, noting that the report has been an "extremely important,"^[Response 1475.] "very effective,"^[Response 1442.] and "quite useful"^[Response 1390.] tool that allows the US government to "[suggest] changes to anti-trafficking laws and policy, [raise] awareness about trafficking, and [increase] [foreign government] attention to trafficking."^[Response 1158.] NGOs also describe US officials using the report to threaten, pressure, and embarrass offending governments,^[Responses 1017, 1158, and 1259.] and state that the report "force[s] an official response from the government … every year when it is released."^[Response 1387.] In several cases, NGOs report that embassies invite high-ranking government officials and party leaders for formal discussions about the report's recommendations and future steps.^[Responses 1104, 1259, and 1360.]

These visits with government officials go beyond simply raising awareness of TIP issues. Approximately a third of respondents (31%) report that State Department or embassy staff have explicitly asked or lobbied for anti-TIP legislation. One organization observed that each time the US ambassador meets with government officials, he reminds them of the need to finalize national legislation and adhere to UN security council resolutions related to trafficking and women's rights.^[Response 1202.] In other countries, NGOs state that the US encouraged and lobbied presidents, prime ministers, and legislators to adopt a wide range of laws mandating increased monitoring through regular data collection and inspections, improved prosecutions under stricter criminal statutes, tighter border controls and travel restrictions.^[Responses 1021, 1213, 1274, 1307, 1353, 1486, and 1505.] Two NGOs made special note of formal visits between their countries' respective presidents and then-Secretary Clinton where she explicitly encouraged and lobbied for anti-TIP regulations.^[Responses 1251 and 1255.]

Beyond lobbying, NGOs report that the US has helped governments develop practical TIP action plans (27%) and provided training to officials who oversee those policies (21%). After legislation is passed, NGOs observe American involvement and support in the implementation of new TIP-related policies. In many cases, the US meets with government officials to show examples of actions plans implemented in peer countries and provide other technical assistance and policy guidance.^[Responses 1099, 1327, 1397, and 1514.] Additionally, NGOs note that embassy officials help form intergovernmental task forces and inter-ministerial steering groups to coordinate anti-TIP efforts among various branches of government, as well as organize national trafficking coalitions to integrate government and civil society strategies and programs.^[Responses 1287, 1288, 1290, and 1311.] In at least one country, embassy staff are formal members of the secretariat for the national TIP commission.^[Response 1360.]

NGOs also report that the United States provides extensive training for those who oversee and implement these national policies. The State Department works with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Department of Homeland Security to provide specialized trainings both in-country and in the United States for foreign law enforcement officers, military personnel, intelligence agents, and counter-trafficking unit staff.^[Responses 1084, 1204, 1251, 1280, 1288, 1336, and 1349.] Embassies also partner with the US Department of Justice to organize trainings to orient judges and prosecutors about the new national legislation and assist with its practical legal implementation.^[Responses 1162, 1381, and 1494.] However, not all this assistance has been useful—one NGO criticizes the fact that "the US government has pulled in huge resources for training … government officials[,] but no concrete results [can] be found," in part because "the [foreign] officials have no interest in such training."^[Response 1298.]

### Public anti-TIP advocacy

The US does not limit its anti-TIP advocacy to high-level government officials. Approximately 40% of respondents report that the US has worked to raise public awareness of TIP issues in the countries they work in. In many countries, US embassies hold special press conferences and other national human trafficking events following the release of the annual TIP report and publicly acknowledge any TIP Heroes or other recipients of special US awards.^[Responses 1037, 1179, 1208, 1274, 1311, 1336, and 1353.] For example, Ghanaian NGOs describe how the embassy celebrated the fact that a local activist was awarded the US Department of Labor's Iqbal Masih award for the elimination of child labor, while NGOs working in Ukraine report that the embassy holds its own annual human trafficking awards ceremony for local anti-TIP activists. In addition to these larger events, embassies hold town hall meetings, film nights, and other events and discussions with featured speakers and experts and use social media platforms (including embassy Facebook and Twitter accounts) to directly engage with the broader public.^[Responses 1011, 1019, 1369, and 1503.] Embassies also often work directly with national and local media, producing public service announcements and partnering with community leaders, religious figures, and prominent television and movie actors as part of public information campaigns.^[Responses 1019, 1035, 1084, and 1288.]

Beyond promoting awareness, NGOs report that the US engages directly in many other public-facing anti-TIP activities. Nearly 40% of respondents indicated that the US had convened special workshops and conferences focused on TIP issues in the countries they work in. These workshops tend to be structured as one-day training sessions focused on "trying to get everybody to work together."^[Response 1254.] Embassy officials bring together American federal agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, domestic law enforcement agencies, local and national government officials, civil society leaders, and all other relevant stakeholders to discuss trafficking issues and formulate policies. Many NGOs applaud these efforts, claiming that they are especially good at bringing government and civil society together and providing space to "express their opinions [and] share their experiences" with policymakers.^[Response 1104.] Workshops aimed specifically at linking NGO and government policy efforts are seen as especially effective.^[Response 1351.] NGOs also report that embassies often hold specialized workshops aimed at training and increasing awareness and sensitization for specific industries and firms that tend to be more vulnerable and prone to trafficking, including orphanages, military bases, and the construction and transportation sectors.^[Responses 1072, 1235, 1382 and 1479.]

Not all NGOs feel that these workshops and trainings are useful, however. While most claim that the workshops are good, many noted that the embassy "didn't invite as many people" as they would have liked to see,^[Response 1254.] "discussion time is too [short],"^[Response 1457.] and that there is rarely any follow-up on the discussions, decisions, or promised actions.^[Responses 1227 and 1457.] Some also criticized the embassy for being too insular and limiting participation to only a few prominent NGOs, and several expressed a desire to be invited to future conferences.^[Responses 1372 and 1378.] In short, though NGOs generally see US-run workshops and conferences as useful venues for promoting anti-TIP policy and advocacy, these events are often insufficient. "Why stop there?," asked one respondent—"If this is a country flagged by the US, why stop there? We need to provide more help and training."^[Response 1254.]

Many NGOs do report that the US does provide much of this "help and training," however, by funding NGO-led initiatives for improving awareness of trafficking and for providing legal and social services for trafficking victims. Nearly 40% of respondents indicated that the US had provided resources or funding for these local organizations and initiatives in the countries they work in. Most organizations note that this support is funneled from the State Department through J/TIP, USAID, and other US-backed foundations or local funding agencies. NGOs report receiving small grant awards to prepare television segments, produce fliers and other print materials, direct street dramas, offer school programs, organize rallies, and conduct other awareness-raising activities, including holding local workshops and conferences for the general public.^[Responses 1131, 1196, 1251, 1377, and 1475.] In conjunction with funding for awareness, NGOs also report receiving substantial support for service provision. Organizations used USAID and J/TIP grants to build safe houses, dormitories, treatment centers, and schools for women and underage victims, offering free medical care, psychological counseling, vocational training, and education in addition to providing shelter and safety.^[Responses 1301, 1307, 1353, and 1404.] NGOs have also used this support to launch and maintain hotlines for raising issues with migration, pay for legal assistance and consultation in trafficking-related crimes, and form formal coalitions of local anti-TIP NGOs to lobby for improved legislation throughout the region.^[Responses 1007, 1072, 1203, 1353, and 1485.] 

US financial support to NGOs, however, appears to be uneven. Many respondents noted that US agencies tend to fund large national NGOs while ignoring smaller organizations that work more closely with trafficking victims or with local advocacy. Some noted that the funding process has become too politicized and that "unless there is someone… that influences [the funding decision]… the neediest entities rarely receive [any money]."^[Response 1238.] Others note that other countries such as Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands have given more direct and effective funding to these frontline NGOs, and some have said that they "don't even bother applying" anymore.^[Responses 1115, 1227, 1378, and 1474.] 

---

The majority of NGOs ascribe some importance to the US government's substantial global anti-TIP work (see [@fig:us_importance]). More than half of respondents (61%) report that the US is at least a somewhat important actor in the countries they work in, with over a quarter of all NGOs saying that the US is the *most* important. Many organizations emphasize the US's crucial role in their work, and some go so far as to say that "none of our success would have been possible without the TIP report" and other American support.^[Response 1509.] Only 13% of respondents claim that the US does not play an important role—some organizations noted that US involvement in human trafficking has "very little to [no impact]" and that it "doesn't make much difference,"^[Response 1254.] and that the US embassy often seems "at least ambivalent, [and] at worst disinterested" and shows "little real interest other than meaningless talk and unsubstantiated promises."^[Response 1221.] Opinions of American importance vary by country as well. [@fig:avg_importance] displays the average level of reported US importance from NGOs in countries with at least 10 responses. NGOs in most developing countries report average US importance, while more developed countries like Canada and the United Kingdom ascribe less importance to the US, perhaps indicative of a diminished demand for American anti-TIP assistance in these countries.

## NGO opinions of TIP report

The US State Department's most public facing tool for combatting global human trafficking is its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report. As discussed previously, the TIP report has been criticized for {XXXasdf} and for YYY. However, for many anti-TIP NGOs the report is an important resource for their advocacy and policy work. The overwhelming majority (87%) of the NGOs surveyed were aware of the report, and of those organizations who had heard of it, three-quarters (76%) knew the rating assigned to the country or countries they worked in. About half of the NGOs (52% {VERIFY THIS}) use the TIP report to discuss trafficking issues with the governments of the countries they work, including individual members of parliament, courts, national and local police forces, and community leaders.^[Responses 1077, 1165, 1280, 1296, 1343, 1349, and 1473.] Notably, the majority of respondents (78% {Verify this})use the TIP report in their work with other NGOs, indicating its importance within the NGO community. Many organizations reference the report when working with local church groups, schools, trade unions, community centers, youth organizations, and other domestic civil society organizations.^[Responses 1008, 1144, 1247, 1343, 1371, 1422, 1463, and 1463.] Others cite the report in their own advocacy literature and annual reports.^[Responses 1190, 1286, 1292, 1325, 1337, 1420, and 1437.]

Not all NGOs view the TIP report positively, however. Several organizations found it unhelpful and superficial, stating that it "simpl[y] takes the words that our organization and other partners already have"^[Response 1157.] or that it does not reflect the reality of trafficking issues.^[Responses 1076 and 1079.] Some had stronger words, noting that "the TIP report is a joke"^[Response 1254.] and "is so far removed from the truth [that] it appears propagandistic as if paid for by [traffickers] themselves."^[Response 1060.] Another NGO found that using the TIP report in their advocacy posed a significant political risk due to anti-American sentiment in the country they work in.^[Response 1303.] Fourteen NGOs explicitly reported that they do not use the TIP report in any of their work with governments or other NGOs.

As these NGOs advocate and work with governments to improve TIP policy, many have witnessed the effect of the TIP rating on behind-the-scenes politics and policy discussions. {43% DOUBLE CHECK ASDFqwea} of respondents indicated that they had heard officials in the countries they work in mention the TIP tier rating. NGOs report that the governments of the countries they work in tend to mention tier ratings in one of four general contexts. First, many government officials publicly tout their rating to demonstrate or showcase their achievements^[Responses 1090 and 1377.] and promote their countries as models for fighting and preventing human trafficking.^[Response 1246.] Some officials even tout their rating "[at] every possible chance."^[Response 1442.] Second, NGOs report that officials used the TIP ranking to convey shame about their countries' progress. Officials often redirect this shame to help "initiate, justify and strengthen the activities of the government"^[Response 1497.] and provide additional motivation to pursue anti-TIP policies. Third, officials in many countries expressed frustration—both in public and in private—that the TIP report did not adequately reflect progress. One NGO reported holding a private conversation with an official concerned that the poor tier rating makes it "it look like [the government] [doesn't] care, but they actually do."^[Response 1255.] Others note that government officials often feel that they are rated "unfairly"^[Response 1077.] or that the rating is "unjustified."^[Response 1457.] Some officials blame the United States, claiming that "the placement in such a rating is politically motivated does not reflect the actual work of the state,"^[Response 1396, translated from original language.] and that the tier ratings are simply a general reflection of relations with the United States. Other government officials accuse NGOs—which provide much of the source material for the TIP report—of "making false claims."^[Response 1029.] Finally, in a few cases, NGOs report that governments have used favorable tier rankings as an excuse to stop working on TIP issues, stating that a common government response is that "because [the country] has been ranked tier 1, there is no need to take additional action" or pursue further anti-TIP legislation.^[Response 1387.]

With few exceptions, the experiences of the NGOs we surveyed reflect the rankings and progress in trafficking policy noted in the TIP report. …  ANECDOTES FROM INDIA - India because NGOs are insular, hyper focused on local issues - country is so big

## Statsy things



An important caveat: these statistical findings are solely descriptive and serve to help interpret many of the trends we discovered in the anti-TIP NGO sector. We use inferential statistics only to measure differences in group means, not to test *a priori* hypotheses selected to prove or disprove any theories. 


Check different determinants of positive/negative relationship + opinions of importance - do any of these things make NGOs like the US more or less or make them think that the US is more/less important?

2 DVs - positivity (Q3.25) and importance (Q3.19) (though positivity is censored by importance)
