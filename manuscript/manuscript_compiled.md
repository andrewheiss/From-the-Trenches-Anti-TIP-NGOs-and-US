The United States has also long been criticized for … {conflating anti-human trafficking advocacy and support with US foreign policy goals and diplomatic self-interest + anti-TIP efforts just another tool of American foreign policy + more on the negative backlash against US involvement in TIP + we didn't even start monitoring ourselves until 20XX} {reference Reuters article about playing with rankings of 14 different countries to keep diplomatic relations happy: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/04/us-usa-humantrafficking-disputes-special-idUSKCN0Q821Y20150804}

Amid all the academic and policy debates over the role of the United States in fighting human trafficking and its relationship with civil society organizations, one key perspective has been drowned out: what do these anti-TIP NGOs think of their relationship with the US? 

{Why NGOs are valid assessors of this + nobody's ever asked *them* before + this is the first time anyone has reached out to all these NGOs at once + we let *them* speak, give them a voice (albeit anonymously and in aggregate)}

Collaboration with civil society organizations and NGOs has long been part of the United States' core strategy for battling human trafficking around the world. The US State Department's Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report—compiled annually since 2001 by the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP)—is perhaps the most visible symbol of the relationship between the US and anti-TIP NGOs. Since the report's inception, the State Department has worked in close partnership with NGOs, using published reports and expert testimony from the activists and advocates working directly with human trafficking victims. For the first three years of the report, NGOs were regularly acknowledge for their advocacy and assistance with information gathering. In 2004, under the direction of Secretary of State Colin Powell, the State Department added a new regular "TIP Heroes" section to the report to highlight the courageous work of important and prominent activists from these NGOs. In 2009, Secretary Hilary Clinton brought selected heroes to press conference for the release of the annual TIP report and invited them to give speeches about their work, providing these activists with a very public platform to highlight their advocacy. Secretary John Kerry has continued and strengthened this tradition—in 2015, the State Department partnered with the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center to publish a website dedicated to its 100 TIP heroes.^[See [www.tipheroes.org](http://www.tipheroes.org/).]

Beyond providing much of the raw material for TIP reports and producing powerful drama, anti-TIP NGOs and the US have a much deeper practical relationship. In his introductory remarks during the release of the 2015 TIP report, Secretary Kerry applauded these NGOs and identified them as central to the fight against human trafficking, noting that "there are leaders from civil society here, and they are, all of them, bolstering the networks that are being built around the world to try to fight back, increasingly creating sophisticated strategies, and *that’s the only way we’re going to succeed in this battle*."^[[http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm](http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm), emphasis added.] {More on the need for the US to work with on-the-ground NGOs; it *has* to network and collaborate with other activists to have any effect}

{Brief outline of the article}


What can we learn from the boomerang model - other actors using NGOs + cooptation and principal-agent donor-recipient stuff - US using NGOs (we see that working because the NGOs are using the report in their advocacy, which is what the state department wants to happen) - how information is used/diffused/distributed by actors + spread of norms (through workshops, trainings)

# The United States and anti-TIP advocacy

{US surprisingly active and more well regarded than anticipated, standing in contrast with activists and governments critical of the TIP reports, angry at its bias and inconsistencies - even governments - but on-the-ground NGOs are happy with it, use it regularly, don't worry about the biases and other issues - useful tool, better than nothing}

{Stuff from Judith's chapter 2…}

* TIP is a big global problem that requires global cooperation
* US involvement
	* Scorecard diplomacy
	* Economic tools
	* Funding, sanctions

Should the US be the global policeman - what do NGOs think of that role? Are they concerned that the US is so involved?

# Data and methods

To analyze the opinions of non-American anti-TIP NGOs, from July–December 2014 we surveyed more than 500 organizations engaged in anti-trafficking initiatives in 133 countries. To maximize outreach, we searched the State Department's annual TIP reports and Wikileaks cables for mentions of TIP NGOS. We also conducted hundreds of internet searches and partnered with a US-based organization.^[See the Global Modern Slavery Directory, [http://globalmodernslavery.org](http://globalmodernslavery.org), maintained by the Polaris Project.] These efforts produced a final database of 1,421 anti-TIP NGOs, of which 1,103 had valid contact information, were still in operation, or were not duplicates. We received responses from 480 unique organizations, yielding a response rate of 43.5%, which is comparable to or exceeds that of other NGO surveys [see @BaruchHoltom:2008; @citeme2]. Because NGOs often work in multiple countries, we allowed respondents to answer a series of country-specific questions for up to five different countries, resulting in 561 country-organization responses. The majority of respondents (415, or 86.5%) chose to answer for only one country, while 65 respondents reported on TIP work in two or more countries.

Our choice to conduct an online survey poses several methodological issues. Collecting data solely through the internet introduces technology and language bias. Collecting data solely through the internet introduces technology and language bias. Small grassroots organizations without an online presence are completely missing from our database. Some NGOs mentioned in Wikileaks cables or State Department reports were absent online, perhaps because they no longer operate. Additionally, NGOs without easy internet access faced barriers to participation. As a result, the survey does not represent the entire sector. Finally, all surveys have response bias—willingness to participate is rarely random.

We took several additional steps to address these biases and threats to validity, based on the methods used by @Buthe:2011 and recommendations laid out by @EdwardsRobertsClarke:2009. To encourage participation, we sent each NGO a set of three personalized e-mail invitations, re-sent approximately every two weeks. Organizations without a working e-mail address were contacted by phone. Finally, we posted an invitation to participate in the survey in a LinkedIn discussion group used by anti-trafficking NGOs. Each invitation included a link to the survey and an offer to complete the survey via phone, and respondents were allowed to remain anonymous. To reduce language barriers, we translated the survey into Spanish and Russian and encouraged respondents to answer all free-response questions in their native language. We provided additional reminders and assistance to respondents who began the survey but did not complete it (often due to technological issues). The vast majority of respondents (463, or 96.5%) completed the survey online; 14 were completed over the phone and 3 were collected via the LinkedIn invitation.

Finally, to avoid response-bias and cueing respondents who might have particular views of the US, we framed the survey as an effort to better understand the anti-TIP advocacy sector in general. To reinforce this emphasis, we first asked respondents about their organizations in general and their knowledge of TIP issues in the countries they work in, and then asked which actors (embassies, NGOs, international organizations, etc.) had been active in those countries, allowing them to volunteer information about the US embassy without prompting. Only *after this* did we ask questions specifically about the presence and quality of the United States' anti-TIP work. In 33 instances, respondents did not initially list the US as an active anti-TIP player in the free response question, but later indicated US support and advocacy, which suggests that NGOs did not decide to participate in the survey based on their prior opinions of the United States. Additionally, nearly 90% percent of respondents completed the survey after beginning it, revealing that NGOs generally did not change their decision to participate once the survey turned to US-focused questions. The statement in our invitations that the principal investigator was a professor at an American university was the only indication that the survey could contain questions related specifically to the United States. However, the invitation emphasized that the purpose of the survey was to help build a complete database of anti-TIP NGOs and to understand their efforts. The language of the invitation and the entire survey can be found at {URL HERE}. Thus, opinions of the US and its anti-TIP efforts are unlikely to have influenced decisions to participate in the survey, reducing response-bias.

In our analysis, we merge survey responses with several supplementary data sources in order to compare NGO experiences with more quantitative country-level characteristics. We calculate each country's average TIP rating between 2000–2015, as well as the absolute change in rating from the first year to the most recent year each country was included in the TIP report.^[Coded as 1, 2, and 3 for each tier level and 2.5 for countries on the Watchlist.] We use data from the 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index to measure each country's visible progress in improving human anti-trafficking prosecution, protection, and prevention [@Cho:2015]. This index is based exclusively on independent assessments of the annual TIP report and measures progress in a host of specific sub-indicators, ultimately yielding a score between 3–15, with higher numbers indicating better progress.^[See [http://www.economics-human-trafficking.net/data-and-reports.html](http://www.economics-human-trafficking.net/data-and-reports.html).] We look at both the official TIP ratings and the 3P index because the two indicators measure different phenomena. TIP ratings reflect formal US diplomatic pressure and act as a form of scorecard diplomacy [@KelleySimmons:2014], while the 3P index reflects the progress that governments have made in improving the legal environment for managing TIP issues. As with the raw tier ratings, we calculate each country's average TIP policy index and the absolute change between the first and most recent year. Finally, we use the sum of political rights and civil liberties from Freedom House's *Freedom in the World* index as a proxy for a country's level of democratization.^[See [https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world](https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world).]

For the sake of simplicity, we do not use advanced statistical methods or models, turning instead to basic summary statistics and cross-tabulations. The statistical findings we report are solely descriptive and serve to help interpret many of the trends we discovered in the anti-TIP NGO sector. We use inferential statistics (such as *t*-tests and chi-square tests) only to check for differences in means and associations between responses, not to test *a priori* hypotheses selected to prove or disprove any theories. 

In addition to statistical analysis, we rely heavily on interpretive qualitative analysis of NGOs' free response answers—82% of respondents chose to answer at least one of the 12 open-ended questions. One of this study's primary contributions is to allow NGOs themselves to speak about their experiences, and as such, we extensively quote their responses. To maintain anonymity (even when NGOs expressed willingness to be identified), we removed all potentially identifiable information from any quotes used in this paper, indicating the source of each quote with a randomly-assigned four-digit ID number. 

# Findings

As described previously, the motivations, effectiveness, and positivity of the United States' anti-trafficking efforts have been hotly contested. In the midst of these debates, the NGOs that implement and support anti-TIP policies—organizations that advocate and lobby for local legislative changes, run shelters and safe houses, or assist with victims' legal, social, and financial needs—have generally been ignored. What do *they* think of the US's intense focus on trafficking and how are *they* affected by these efforts? We analyzed the results of our survey to answer three general questions about the anti-TIP NGO sector and its relationship to the United States government: 

1. What does the anti-TIP NGO sector look like and what kind of work do they do?
2. How do anti-TIP NGOs see and interpret the United States' anti-trafficking efforts?
3. What do anti-TIP NGOs think of the United States' efforts and what influences that opinion?

## What does the anti-TIP NGO sector look like?

### Where do anti-TIP NGOs work?

The anti-TIP NGOs we surveyed are spread throughout the world and have a nearly global reach ([@fig:maps]). As seen in [@fig:locations], 60% of NGOs have their headquarters in either Asia or Europe, roughly a quarter are based in North or South America, and fewer than 20% work out of Africa. NGOs are hardly limited to advocacy within their own countries—the majority of these organizations work in Asia (especially in trafficking hotspots like India, Nepal, Thailand, and the Philippines), with less work in Europe and the Americas. Though there are fewer NGOs *based* in Africa, a larger proportion of NGOs *work* there than in the Americas. Organizations based in the Americas, in particular, are more likely to work outside their home regions: only 50% of American NGOs work in the Americas, with 30% working in Asia and 12% in Africa. In contrast, NGOs based elsewhere are much more likely to stay close to home, as 98%, 97%, and 83% of NGOs headquartered in Asia, Africa, and Africa work in their respective regions.

### What do anti-TIP NGOs do?

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_what_do.md"

On average, anti-TIP NGOs spend a little over half of their time and resources focused specifically on fighting trafficking and assisting victims and an overwhelming majority (93%) have at least some knowledge about TIP issues in the countries they work in. Most organizations concentrate specifically on sex (85%) and labor (61%) trafficking issues, and 50% focus on both simultaneously. A handful of organizations (30, or 6%) work with human organ trafficking, and dozens of others deal with other issues such as brokered marriages, domestic servitude, illegal adoptions, and forced begging.

Approximately two-thirds of NGOs serve and advocate for either children or adult trafficking victims, and many of those who work with adults specified working especially with women and young girls. No type of trafficking issue is more pronounced among different categories of victims—that is, NGOs are generally equally as likely to help both children and adults with either sex or labor trafficking. NGOs differ in their strategies and efforts in addressing trafficking. The majority of organizations (83%) advocate for prevention and improved education about TIP issues, and nearly three-fourths assist trafficking victims by engaging in direct interventions, running safe houses and shelters, operating special hotlines, helping start businesses, and providing physical and emotional health care. NGOs are also involved with less direct forms of advocacy, with 50% working with victim protection—including lobbying and legislative support—and 40% prosecuting traffickers and researching related legal issues. As with the types of victims, NGO strategies do not differ by the type of trafficking organizations address—organizations that address either sex or labor trafficking appear to offer roughly the same mix of programming.

### How do anti-TIP NGOs work with other actors?

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_how_work_others.md"

No anti-TIP NGO works in isolation. Every respondent reported collaborating, partnering, or interacting with other NGOs or civil society organizations, international organizations, foreign embassies, and the national governments of the countries they work in. Nearly every organization (95%) noted that other NGOs and civil society organizations actively deal with trafficking work and often partner with responding NGOs, including religious groups, charities, universities, and community organizations, and a majority of organizations (78%) report discussing the results of the annual TIP report with other NGOs, indicating further collaboration. Around two-thirds of NGOs indicated that international organizations such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are also active participants in anti-TIP advocacy. Less than half of respondents reported that non-American governments are involved in their countries.

We were particularly interested in the relationship between NGOs and the national governments of the countries they work in. Two-thirds of respondents (68%) state that local and national governments have been active in combatting trafficking, and more than half  (53%) report discussing TIP issues directly with the government. In general, governments appear to be helpful overall in addressing TIP policies—61% of NGOs report that the governments in their target countries work at least "somewhat hard" in working against TIP, while 20% feel that those governments have worked "very" or "extremely" hard.

Overall, anti-TIP NGOs are relatively unencumbered by government regulations, with more than a third of respondents reporting that they feel unrestricted in the countries they work in. However, roughly a quarter of NGOs reported feeling either somewhat or very restricted in 66 different countries. The nature of these restrictions varied, ranging from strict legal requirements to general government antagonism or apathy toward NGO programming. In several instances, organizations reported feeling restricted because of tax code limitations on charitable advocacy, similar to the political advocacy limitations the US imposes on 501(c)(3) charities.^[Responses 1228 and 1265.] Other organizations responded that informal restrictions, such as corruption or inefficiency in the police and government bureaucracy, impose barriers to advocacy. For example, one NGO reported that "we [have] to be certified and continue to submit to monthly reporting, mandatory financial audits, site visits, social welfare approval, government regulations regarding our aftercare property, work permits for all foreign volunteers, annual reporting and additional certifications,"^[Response 1280.] while another noted that "[a]ll work must be approved and done in direct concert with government counterparts. [Our] presence in country [is] controlled and evaluated by government officials, even those who are not familiar with our work."^[Response 1157.] The burden of complying with uncertain regulations can have a direct effect on NGO effectiveness and detract from their work, limiting their ability to protect victims and prosecute offenders.^[Responses 1016, 1049, 1061, 1118, 1336, 1388, and 1389, among others.]

## How do anti-TIP NGOs see and interpret the United States' anti-trafficking efforts?

As central partners against human trafficking, NGOs have observed firsthand the United States' intense anti-TIP efforts (see [@fig:activities]) throughout the world over the past 15 years. Accordingly, NGOs have a unique perspective of the implementation, effectiveness, and effects of American efforts. The organizations that responded to our survey were quite forthcoming about their experiences with and opinions of the United States' anti-TIP work. NGOs almost universally identified the US as the central driving force for TIP advocacy in the countries they work in. Respondents observed the power and utility of the US State Department's annual TIP report, which empowers both American diplomats and NGOs themselves as they confront and collaborate with national politicians and bureaucrats. NGOs noted that the United States has been particularly effective in its work with local governments, using its TIP reports to pressure governments to implement reforms and then assisting with the practical implementation of new anti-TIP legislation. Finally, NGOs described the mixed results of the United States' public advocacy. We detail each of these topics in turn.

![Activities and programming sponsored by the US embassy, as reported by NGOs](figures/fig_activities.pdf) {#fig:activities}

### The preeminence of the United States

While the fight against human trafficking is global in scope and involves the efforts of dozens of foreign governments, NGOs note that the United States is by far one of the most active and influential actors. We asked respondents to indicate which embassies they knew to be active in anti-TIP work in each of the countries they work in, and which of those governments were most active. NGOs identified 64 different foreign or regional governments as active, and 78% of respondents included the US embassy or government in their list (see [@fig:embassies]). In fact, the United States was mentioned six times more often (260 mentions) than the next most common country, the United Kingdom (43 mentions). Respondents identified 39 countries or regions as the *most* active, and 71% named the US. Again, the United States was overwhelmingly the most cited foreign actor, mentioned 14 times more often (187 mentions) than the next most common government, the European Union (14 mentions). When asked directly about US activities, only 39 NGOs (7.3%) explicitly reported that the US had *not* been involved in any of the countries they work in.

![Embassies or foreign governments NGOs reported as active partners in the fight against human trafficking](figures/fig_embassies.pdf) {#fig:embassies}

### The TIP report and scorecard diplomacy

From the perspective of anti-TIP NGOs, the US State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons report is perhaps the US government's most potent tool for confronting or working with foreign governments. As discussed previously, the TIP report has been criticized for {XXX and for YYY}. However, for many anti-TIP NGOs the report is an important resource for their advocacy and policy work. The overwhelming majority (87%) of the NGOs surveyed were aware of the report, and of those organizations who had heard of it, three-quarters (76%) knew the rating assigned to the country or countries they worked in. About half of the NGOs (52%) use the TIP report to discuss trafficking issues with the governments of the countries they work, including individual members of parliament, courts, national and local police forces, and community leaders.^[Responses 1077, 1165, 1280, 1296, 1343, 1349, and 1473.] Notably, the majority of respondents (78%) use the TIP report in their work with other NGOs, indicating its importance within the NGO community. Many organizations reference the report when working with local church groups, schools, trade unions, community centers, youth organizations, and other domestic civil society organizations.^[Responses 1008, 1144, 1247, 1343, 1371, 1422, 1463, and 1463.] Others cite the report in their own advocacy literature and annual reports.^[Responses 1190, 1286, 1292, 1325, 1337, 1420, and 1437.]

!INCLUDE "tables/summary_tip_report.md"

Not all NGOs view the TIP report positively, however. Several organizations found it unhelpful and superficial, stating that it "simpl[y] takes the words that our organization and other partners already have"^[Response 1157.] or that it does not reflect the reality of trafficking issues.^[Responses 1076 and 1079.] Some had stronger words, noting that "the TIP report is a joke"^[Response 1254.] and "is so far removed from the truth [that] it appears propagandistic as if paid for by [traffickers] themselves."^[Response 1060.] Another NGO found that using the TIP report in their advocacy posed a significant political risk due to anti-American sentiment in the country they work in.^[Response 1303.] Fourteen NGOs explicitly reported that they do not use the TIP report in any of their work with governments or other NGOs.

As these NGOs advocate and work with governments to improve TIP policy, many have witnessed the effect of the TIP rating on behind-the-scenes politics and policy discussions—a little less than half of respondents (43%) indicated that they had heard officials in the countries they work in mention the TIP tier rating. NGOs report that the governments of the countries they work in tend to mention tier ratings in one of four general contexts. First, many government officials publicly tout their rating to demonstrate or showcase their achievements^[Responses 1090 and 1377.] and promote their countries as models for fighting and preventing human trafficking.^[Response 1246.] Some officials even tout their rating "[at] every possible chance."^[Response 1442.] Second, NGOs report that officials used the TIP ranking to convey shame about their countries' progress. Officials often redirect this shame to help "initiate, justify and strengthen the activities of the government"^[Response 1497.] and provide additional motivation to pursue anti-TIP policies. Third, officials in many countries expressed frustration—both in public and in private—that the TIP report did not adequately reflect progress. One NGO reported holding a private conversation with an official concerned that the poor tier rating makes it "it look like [the government] [doesn't] care, but they actually do."^[Response 1255.] Others note that government officials often feel that they are rated "unfairly"^[Response 1077.] or that the rating is "unjustified."^[Response 1457.] Some officials blame the United States, claiming that "the placement in such a rating is politically motivated does not reflect the actual work of the state,"^[Response 1396, translated from original language.] and that the tier ratings are simply a general reflection of relations with the United States. Other government officials accuse NGOs—which provide much of the source material for the TIP report—of "making false claims."^[Response 1029.] Finally, in a few cases, NGOs report that governments have used favorable tier rankings as an excuse to stop working on TIP issues, stating that a common government response is that "because [the country] has been ranked tier 1, there is no need to take additional action" or pursue further anti-TIP legislation.^[Response 1387.]

### The United States' work with national governments

More than 40% of respondents indicated that the United States has increased government attention to TIP issues in the countries they work in, and the majority of these organizations specifically noted that the US embassy had used the TIP report to do so. Many see the report as the United States' primary means for working directly with foreign governments, noting that the report has been an "extremely important,"^[Response 1475.] "very effective,"^[Response 1442.] and "quite useful"^[Response 1390.] tool that allows the US government to "[suggest] changes to anti-trafficking laws and policy, [raise] awareness about trafficking, and [increase] [foreign government] attention to trafficking."^[Response 1158.] NGOs also describe US officials using the report to threaten, pressure, and embarrass offending governments,^[Responses 1017, 1158, and 1259.] and state that the report "force[s] an official response from the government … every year when it is released."^[Response 1387.] In several cases, NGOs report that embassies invite high-ranking government officials and party leaders for formal discussions about the report's recommendations and future steps.^[Responses 1104, 1259, and 1360.]

These visits with government officials go beyond simply raising awareness of TIP issues. Approximately a third of respondents (31%) report that State Department or embassy staff have explicitly asked or lobbied for anti-TIP legislation. One organization observed that each time the US ambassador meets with government officials, he reminds them of the need to finalize national legislation and adhere to UN security council resolutions related to trafficking and women's rights.^[Response 1202.] In other countries, NGOs state that the US encouraged and lobbied presidents, prime ministers, and legislators to adopt a wide range of laws mandating increased monitoring through regular data collection and inspections, improved prosecutions under stricter criminal statutes, tighter border controls and travel restrictions.^[Responses 1021, 1213, 1274, 1307, 1353, 1486, and 1505.] Two NGOs made special note of formal visits between their countries' respective presidents and then-Secretary Clinton where she explicitly encouraged and lobbied for anti-TIP regulations.^[Responses 1251 and 1255.]

Beyond lobbying, NGOs report that the US has helped governments develop practical TIP action plans (27%) and provided training to officials who oversee those policies (21%). After legislation is passed, NGOs observe American involvement and support in the implementation of new TIP-related policies. In many cases, the US meets with government officials to show examples of actions plans implemented in peer countries and provide other technical assistance and policy guidance.^[Responses 1099, 1327, 1397, and 1514.] Additionally, NGOs note that embassy officials help form intergovernmental task forces and inter-ministerial steering groups to coordinate anti-TIP efforts among various branches of government, as well as organize national trafficking coalitions to integrate government and civil society strategies and programs.^[Responses 1287, 1288, 1290, and 1311.] In at least one country, embassy staff are formal members of the secretariat for the national TIP commission.^[Response 1360.]

NGOs also report that the United States provides extensive training for those who oversee and implement these national policies. The State Department works with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Department of Homeland Security to provide specialized trainings both in-country and in the United States for foreign law enforcement officers, military personnel, intelligence agents, and counter-trafficking unit staff.^[Responses 1084, 1204, 1251, 1280, 1288, 1336, and 1349.] Embassies also partner with the US Department of Justice to organize trainings to orient judges and prosecutors about the new national legislation and assist with its practical legal implementation.^[Responses 1162, 1381, and 1494.] However, not all this assistance has been useful—one NGO criticizes the fact that "the US government has pulled in huge resources for training … government officials[,] but no concrete results [can] be found," in part because "the [foreign] officials have no interest in such training."^[Response 1298.]

### The United States and public advocacy

The US does not limit its anti-TIP advocacy to high-level government officials. Approximately 40% of respondents report that the US has worked to raise public awareness of TIP issues in the countries they work in. In many countries, US embassies hold special press conferences and other national human trafficking events following the release of the annual TIP report and publicly acknowledge any TIP Heroes or other recipients of special US awards.^[Responses 1037, 1179, 1208, 1274, 1311, 1336, and 1353.] For example, Ghanaian NGOs describe how the embassy celebrated the fact that a local activist was awarded the US Department of Labor's Iqbal Masih award for the elimination of child labor, while NGOs working in Ukraine report that the embassy holds its own annual human trafficking awards ceremony for local anti-TIP activists. In addition to these larger events, embassies hold town hall meetings, film nights, and other events and discussions with featured speakers and experts and use social media platforms (including embassy Facebook and Twitter accounts) to directly engage with the broader public.^[Responses 1011, 1019, 1369, and 1503.] Embassies also often work directly with national and local media, producing public service announcements and partnering with community leaders, religious figures, and prominent television and movie actors as part of public information campaigns.^[Responses 1019, 1035, 1084, and 1288.]

In addition to promoting awareness, NGOs report that the US engages directly in many other public-facing anti-TIP activities. Nearly 40% of respondents indicated that the US had convened special workshops and conferences focused on TIP issues in the countries they work in. These workshops tend to be structured as one-day training sessions focused on "trying to get everybody to work together."^[Response 1254.] Embassy officials bring together American federal agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, domestic law enforcement agencies, local and national government officials, civil society leaders, and all other relevant stakeholders to discuss trafficking issues and formulate policies. Many NGOs applaud these efforts, claiming that they are especially good at bringing government and civil society together and providing space to "express their opinions [and] share their experiences" with policymakers.^[Response 1104.] Workshops aimed specifically at linking NGO and government policy efforts are seen as especially effective.^[Response 1351.] NGOs also report that embassies often hold specialized workshops aimed at training and increasing awareness and sensitization for specific industries and firms that tend to be more vulnerable and prone to trafficking, including orphanages, military bases, and the construction and transportation sectors.^[Responses 1072, 1235, 1382 and 1479.]

Not all NGOs feel that these workshops and trainings are useful, however. While most claim that the workshops are good, many noted that the embassy "didn't invite as many people" as they would have liked to see,^[Response 1254.] "discussion time is too [short],"^[Response 1457.] and that there is rarely any follow-up on the discussions, decisions, or promised actions.^[Responses 1227 and 1457.] Some also criticized the embassy for being too insular and limiting participation to only a few prominent NGOs, and several expressed a desire to be invited to future conferences.^[Responses 1372 and 1378.] In short, though NGOs generally see US-run workshops and conferences as useful venues for promoting anti-TIP policy and advocacy, these events are often insufficient. "Why stop there?," asked one respondent—"If this is a country flagged by the US, why stop there? We need to provide more help and training."^[Response 1254.]

Many NGOs do report that the US does provide much of this help and training, however, by funding NGO-led initiatives for improving awareness of trafficking and for providing legal and social services for trafficking victims. Nearly 40% of respondents indicated that the US had provided resources or funding for these local organizations and initiatives in the countries they work in. Most organizations note that this support is funneled from the State Department through J/TIP, USAID, and other US-backed foundations or local funding agencies. NGOs report receiving small grant awards to prepare television segments, produce fliers and other print materials, direct street dramas, offer school programs, organize rallies, and conduct other awareness-raising activities, including holding local workshops and conferences for the general public.^[Responses 1131, 1196, 1251, 1377, and 1475.] In conjunction with funding for awareness, NGOs also report receiving substantial support for service provision. Organizations used USAID and J/TIP grants to build safe houses, dormitories, treatment centers, and schools for women and underage victims, offering free medical care, psychological counseling, vocational training, and education in addition to providing shelter and safety.^[Responses 1301, 1307, 1353, and 1404.] NGOs have also used this support to launch and maintain hotlines for raising issues with migration, pay for legal assistance and consultation in trafficking-related crimes, and form formal coalitions of local anti-TIP NGOs to lobby for improved legislation throughout the region.^[Responses 1007, 1072, 1203, 1353, and 1485.] 

US financial support to NGOs, however, appears to be uneven. Many respondents noted that US agencies tend to fund large national NGOs while ignoring smaller organizations that work more closely with trafficking victims or with local advocacy. Some noted that the funding process has become too politicized and that "unless there is someone… that influences [the funding decision]… the neediest entities rarely receive [any money]."^[Response 1238.] Others note that other countries such as Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands have given more direct and effective funding to these frontline NGOs, and some have said that they "don't even bother applying" anymore.^[Responses 1115, 1227, 1378, and 1474.] 

## What do anti-TIP NGOs think of the United States' efforts and what influences that opinion?

### Importance

The majority of NGOs ascribe some importance to the US government's substantial global anti-TIP work (see [@tbl:us_opinions]). More than half of respondents (61%) report that the US is at least a somewhat important actor in the countries they work in, with over a quarter of all NGOs saying that the US is the *most* important. Many organizations emphasize the US's crucial role in their work, and some go so far as to say that "none of our success would have been possible without the TIP report" and other American support.^[Response 1509.] Only 13% of respondents claim that the US does not play an important role—some organizations noted that US involvement in human trafficking has "very little to [no impact]" and that it "doesn't make much difference,"^[Response 1254.] and that the US embassy often seems "at least ambivalent, [and] at worst disinterested" and shows "little real interest other than meaningless talk and unsubstantiated promises."^[Response 1221.]

Despite its preeminence in anti-TIP advocacy, opinions of American importance are clearly varied. We offer a collection of statistical associations to attempt to explain some of the variation in opinions (see [@tbl:importance_stats]). As we warned earlier, in the absence of experimental data, these findings are merely correlations and as such, we do not assert causality. However, we can see some inklings of the determinants of NGO opinions of US importance. We observe associations between both country- and organization-level characteristics and NGO opinions of US-led anti-TIP advocacy.

Opinions of American importance vary by the country NGOs work in. [@fig:avg_importance] displays the average level of reported US importance from NGOs in countries with at least 10 responses. On average, NGOs in most developing countries tend to attribute some importance to the US, while more developed countries like Canada and the United Kingdom ascribe the least importance, perhaps indicative of a diminished demand for American anti-TIP assistance in these countries. This association holds up when looking at the level of democratic development in these countries. On average, NGOs working in countries with worse civil rights and political liberties are more likely to see the US as the most important anti-TIP actor in that country, and the overall differences between average total freedom across the possible responses are statistically significant.

The severity of human trafficking in these countries is also associated with NGO opinions of importance. NGOs that think the US is the most important anti-TIP actor tend to work in countries with worse average TIP report tier ratings, while organizations that see the US as less important tend to work in countries with better average ratings. These country averages only capture the US State Department's opinion of the country's status and do not show any changes over time or reflect improvements in the actual TIP policy environment. Improvements in tier ratings (that is, the difference between a country's first recorded rating and its most recent rating) are not associated with differences in opinion—there is no statistically significant difference in average improvement in tier ratings across the range of opinions of US importance. Improvements in TIP policies (as measured by the 3P index), on the other hand, are tentatively associated with opinions of American importance, with NGOs reporting greater importance in countries with larger improvements in observed policies. Finally, the amount of TIP funding granted to the countries NGOs work in is strongly associated with opinions of importance—organizations are significantly more likely to thing that the US is an important actor if they work in countries receiving more anti-TIP funding.

Money also influences opinions at an organizational level. The majority of NGOs that report receiving funding directly from the US feel that it is the most important anti-TIP actor, and the association between funding and opinion of importance is strongly significant. Having any kind of encounter or involvement with the US embassy, including direct contact, meetings, or other types of cooperation, is associated with higher opinions of US importance. NGOs that reported that the US was not an important actor were more likely to have not been involved with the US. Importantly, direct experience with the US appears to be more strongly associated with opinions than simple connections to the US—NGOs that are headquartered in the US are not significantly different from their foreign counterparts in their opinions of American importance.
