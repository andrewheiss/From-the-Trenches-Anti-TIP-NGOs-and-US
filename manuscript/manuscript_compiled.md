Collaboration with civil society organizations and NGOs has long been part of the United States' core strategy for battling human trafficking around the world. The US State Department's Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report—published annually since 2001—is perhaps the most visible symbol of the relationship between the US and anti-TIP NGOs.

And here's why NGOs are valid assessors of this - nobody's ever asked *them* before - first time anyone has reached out to all these NGOs at once - let *them* speak


# The United States and anti-TIP advocacy

US surprisingly active and more well regarded than anticipated, standing in contrast with activists and governments critical of the TIP reports, angry at its bias and inconsistencies - even governments - but on-the-ground NGOs are happy with it, use it regularly, don't worry about the biases and other issues - useful tool, better than nothing
