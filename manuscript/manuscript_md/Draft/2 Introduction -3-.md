Amid all the academic and policy debates over the role of the United States in fighting human trafficking and its relationship with civil society organizations, one key perspective has been drowned out: what do these anti-TIP NGOs think of their relationship with the US? 

{Why NGOs are valid assessors of this  + nobody's ever asked *them* before + this is the first time anyone has reached out to all these NGOs at once + we  let *them* speak, give them a voice (albeit anonymously and in aggregate)}

Collaboration with civil society organizations and NGOs has long been part of the United States' core strategy for battling human trafficking around the world. The US State Department's Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report—compiled annually since 2001 by the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP)—is perhaps the most visible symbol of the relationship between the US and anti-TIP NGOs. Since the report's inception, the State Department has worked in close partnership with NGOs, using published reports and expert testimony from the activists and advocates working directly with human trafficking victims. For the first three years of the report, NGOs were regularly acknowledge for their advocacy and assistance with information gathering. In 2004, under the direction of Secretary of State Colin Powell, the State Department added a new regular "TIP Heroes" section to the report to highlight the courageous work of important and prominent activists from these NGOs. In 2009, Secretary Hilary Clinton brought selected heroes to press conference for the release of the annual TIP report and invited them to give speeches about their work, providing these activists with a very public platform to highlight their advocacy. Secretary John Kerry has continued and strengthened this tradition—in 2015, the State Department partnered with the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center to publish a website dedicated to its 100 TIP heroes.^[See [www.tipheroes.org](http://www.tipheroes.org/)]

Beyond providing much of the raw material for TIP reports and producing powerful drama, anti-TIP NGOs and the US have a much deeper practical relationship. In his introductory remarks during the release of the 2015 TIP report, Secretary Kerry applauded these NGOs and identified them as central to the fight against human trafficking, noting that "there are leaders from civil society here, and they are, all of them, bolstering the networks that are being built around the world to try to fight back, increasingly creating sophisticated strategies, and *that’s the only way we’re going to succeed in this battle*."^[[http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm](http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/07/245298.htm), emphasis added.] {More on the need for the US to work with on-the-ground NGOs; it *has* to network and collaborate with other activists to have any effect}
