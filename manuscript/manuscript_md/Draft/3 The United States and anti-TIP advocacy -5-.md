# The United States and anti-TIP advocacy

{US surprisingly active and more well regarded than anticipated, standing in contrast with activists and governments critical of the TIP reports, angry at its bias and inconsistencies - even governments - but on-the-ground NGOs are happy with it, use it regularly, don't worry about the biases and other issues - useful tool, better than nothing}

{Stuff from Judith's chapter 2â€¦}

* TIP is a big global problem that requires global cooperation
* US involvement
	* Scorecard diplomacy
	* Economic tools
	* Funding, sanctions
