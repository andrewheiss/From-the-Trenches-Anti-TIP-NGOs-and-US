Subject: Help with human trafficking research

---

![](tip_banner.png)

Hello,

I am a professor at Duke University in the United States and I am conducting research about human trafficking. As you know, it's really difficult to obtain good information in this area, and I'm hoping you might be willing to help me out by sharing some insights about the work that `organization_name` has done in the past 10 years.

I've created a short survey, about 10 minutes long. If you have time to take it, this would be incredibly helpful and I'd be sure to share the results with you, as well as a database I have gathered with on nearly 700 NGOs working on trafficking in different countries around the world. The survey allows you the option to remain anonymous if you prefer. I would be most grateful if you would complete the survey by `two_week_deadline`.

If you don't like taking surveys, or if you would rather speak via phone, I'd be most delighted to talk with you to learn more about your organization. Feel free to reply to this email and I can follow up one-on-one if you have time.

To access the survey please visit `survey_url`.

If you feel unqualified to answer the questions, could you please let me know if there is a particular person in your office who would be willing to complete the survey or speak with me?

Sincerely,

Judith Kelley
